## Deep Learning for Human Language Processing 

My notes for Prof. Hung-Yi Lee's lectures on [Deep Learning for Human Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV_el3uVTsO07RpBYFsXg-bN5Lu0nhdG). I really enjoy the lectures, I hope my notes are useful.

### Introduction

This course teaches about using **deep learning** to let computer gain the ability to interpret human language, writes or speaks in a way that human is capable of understanding 

**Why is it call Human Language Processing (HLP) instead of Natural Language Processing (NLP) ?**

* Human language exists as **speech** or **text**
* Only 56 % languages have written form
* Most NLP courses and books focus mostly on texts
* In this course, the ratio of focus on text and speech is 5:5

The following table is a oversimplified summary of the coverage of this course :
| Input  | Output | Application                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Audio  | Text   | Speech recognition                                       |
| Audio  | Audio  | Speech separation,  voice conversion                     |
| Audio  | Class  | Speaker recognition,  keyword spotting                   |
| Text   | Audio  | Text-to-Speech synthesis                                 |
| Text   | Text   | Chat-bot, translation, summarization, question answering |
| Text   | Class  | Sentiment analysis                                       |
